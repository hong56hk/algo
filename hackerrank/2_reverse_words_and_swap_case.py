1. Python: Reverse Words and Swap Cases

Implement a function that takes a string consisting of words separated by single spaces and returns a string containing all those 
words but in the reverse order and such that all cases of letters in the original string are swapped, i.e. lowercase letters become 
uppercase and uppercase letters become lowercase.


Example

sentence = "rUns dOg"
Reverse the word order and swap the case of all letters, then return the string "DoG RuNS".

The function has the following parameter(s):
    string sentence: a given string of space-separated words

Returns:
